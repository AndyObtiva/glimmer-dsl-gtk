[Glimmer](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer) DSL for [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) enables building desktop applications with [Ruby-GNOME](https://github.com/ruby-gnome/ruby-gnome).

[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) (aka GIMP-Toolkit or [incorrectly] GNOME-Toolkit) is the premiere desktop GUI toolkit on [Linux](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/linux/), which also runs on [Mac](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/macos/) ([Quartz GTK+](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GTK/OSX)) and [Windows](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/windows).

[Glimmer DSL for GTK](https://rubygems.org/gems/glimmer-dsl-gtk) aims to supercharge productivity and maintainability in developing [Ruby-GNOME](https://github.com/ruby-gnome/ruby-gnome) applications by providing a DSL similar to [Glimmer DSL for SWT](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-dsl-swt) having:
- Declarative DSL syntax that visually maps to the GUI widget hierarchy
- Convention over configuration via smart defaults and automation of low-level details
- Requiring the least amount of syntax possible to build GUI
- Custom Keyword support
- Bidirectional Data-Binding to declaratively wire and automatically synchronize GUI with Business Models
- Scaffolding for new custom widgets, apps, and gems
- Native-Executable packaging on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

## Contributing

-   Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
    implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
-   Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't
    requested it and/or contributed it.
-   Fork the project.
-   Start a feature/bugfix branch.
-   Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
-   Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
    in a future version unintentionally.
-   Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If
    you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that
    is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick
    around it.

## Planned Features and Feature Suggestions

These features have been planned or suggested. You might see them in a future version of [Glimmer DSL for GTK](https://rubygems.org/gems/glimmer-dsl-gtk). You are welcome to contribute more feature suggestions.
